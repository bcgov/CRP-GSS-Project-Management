# ðŸ¦Œ Caribou Portal - PMBOK Project Portfolio

## Description
This app is for the purpose of coordinating/managing CRP project requests. It is built off of python and NiceGUI and writes to JSON files stored on S3. The idea is to have a one stop shop for CRP projects, related data and apps. Currently it pulls notes from a local Dendron vault but will be changed in the future so all can view the notes. 

 ## To Run 
To run this app currently you all you need to do is the run the script **pmbok_project_viewer_list view_s3.py** and open the local port 8080
